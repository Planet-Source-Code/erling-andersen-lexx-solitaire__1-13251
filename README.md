### Description

Shows how to make a card game in VB, with API calls only. No card dlls. Customizable background, card designs & multilingual menu captions. You'll probably get bored of the game pretty fast, but it might teach you some graphical techniques. I'll try to come up with a new and even better version as soon as possible. In the meantime, keep voting for it!!!
 
### More Info
 
To make it work properly, you'll have to unzip the contents of the file to some directory.
